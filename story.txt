green dinosaur
There was a green dinosaur. He was green like the bright leaves you find on trees. 
He was green like the good you find in people's hearts. He was green like cash and coins. 
He was green like unwanted broccoli. Not only was he green, but he had blue teeth. His teeth were blue like moldy cheese. His teeth were blue like the sky at day time. His teeth were blue like feeling you get when you're sad. His teeth were blue like blueberries found in bushes. Though, not only were his teeth blue, he also had an orange heart.
